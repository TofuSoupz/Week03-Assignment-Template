# Hello, world!

Your first task is to write a simple program that outputs the phrase 'Hello, world!' to the console. 
This classic exercise is a traditional starting point for learning any programming language.

## Before You Begin
- Open the `hello.py` file.
- In your terminal, change the directory to `01-hello` with
    ```bash
    cd 01-hello
    ```
- Make the necessary changes to the code as per the instructions.

## How to Run 
- Run the script directly in your terminal with `python hello.py` to see the output.

## Expected Output
When you run your program, the console should display the following text exactly:
```
Hello, world!
```
- **Notice that** it is not `hello world`, or `Hello World` or any other variation.

## How to Test
To ensure that you got the exercise correctly, you can run local tests before you submit your code. If the code passes the test, you are good to submit. If not, you can check the test that failed and fix your code.
Follow these steps to test your code:
- Click on the becker glass icon on the left tab.
- Locate the `01-hello` test. You might need to expand the `week03-assignment` to find it.
- Click on the play arrow to run the test.
- If it is green, the test passed and you should be good to submit this exercise.
- If it is red, you possibly made a mistake. Check the error in the test "Test Results" tab on the view at the bottom of the screen (same location as the Terminal view)

## How to Submit

- Use the VS code Source Control Tab to submit your assignment:
    - Click on the `+` sign next to the files you want to include, in this case `hello.py`
    - Write a commit message, e.g., "Finished with exercise 1"
    - Select "Commit and Push".
- Alternativally, you can use git to add, commit, and push your changes:
    ```bash
    git add hello.py
    git commit -m "Finished with exercise 1"
    git push
    ```
Notice that by doing these steps you are only updating your assignment repository with the solution to this exercise. You still need to work on the other exercises and submit them.
